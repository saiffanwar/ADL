# Applied Deep Learning Coursework

As part of this coursework, we have implemented the shallow architecture proposed in the paper ["Shallow and Deep Convolutional Networks for Saliency Prediction" by J. Pan et al (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00845). We review its performance on the [SALICON dataset](http://salicon.net/), and attempt to further improve on it.

## Installation 

Requires Python 3.7+ installed and dataset pickle files in the root folder of this repo.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
